# SkinSkule
here is the repository my MIE350 team will be using for the development of our website 
Studies suggest that 33% of people omit cleansing their skin at night because it is a hassle, and 22% do not cleanse because they are not sure what to use [1]. As the skin is the largest organ and it is exposed to the external environment, the skin acts as the first line of defence to extraneous chemical and microbial threats [2]. Hence, research studies state that personal skincare is potent to your health and wellbeing. Moreover, using skincare regularly is valued for psychological well-being as it stimulates the somatosensory system, in turn providing a positive reinforcement loop when you regularly use appropriate skincare [3]. With a lack of skincare education consolidated for easy accessible use, our website, SkinSkule, hopes to communicate the benefits and purposes of skincare products by using a comparison method. 

We plan to tailor SkinSkule to women residing in Canada who are in their 20s and 30s, due to government skincare regulations based on ingredients [4]. Our website is versatile with its filterable products page, comparison page, and ratings/reviews. The wide range of capabilities allows SkinSkule to apply to beginners and advanced skincare users. Consequently, SkinSkule has a plethora of stakeholders including skincare companies and distributors, dermatologists, estheticians, and pharmaceuticals. We anticipate that this website would be partnered with skincare companies and distributors that would pay a fee to be featured on our website, however, for the purpose of the project, we assumed a partnership with only Shoppers Drug Mart and Sephora.
